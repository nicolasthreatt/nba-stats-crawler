Certainly! Here's an example of how you can split the code into multiple files based on the suggested structure:

**main.py**:
```python
import argparse
from player_stats import scrape_player
from team_stats import collectTeamStats

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Collect various stats from stats.nba.com/')
    # Add command-line arguments here
    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.players:
        scrape_player(args)
    elif args.teams:
        collectTeamStats(args)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

**player_stats.py**:
```python
import threading
from Player import Player
from BoxScores import Boxscores
from BoxOuts import BoxOuts
# Import other necessary modules

def scrape_player(args):
    # Implement the logic for collecting player stats based on args
    pass

def browseToPlayerStats(player):
    # Implement browsing to player stats logic
    pass

def dbCmd(player, insert, update):
    # Implement database command logic
    pass
```

**team_stats.py**:
```python
import threading
from Team import Team
from BoxScores import Boxscores
from BoxOuts import BoxOuts
# Import other necessary modules

def collectTeamStats(args):
    # Implement the logic for collecting team stats based on args
    pass

def browseToTeamStats(team):
    # Implement browsing to team stats logic
    pass

def dbCmd(teams, insert, update):
    # Implement database command logic
    pass
```

**database_storage.py**:
```python
from DatabaseStorage import playerDB, teamDB

def dbStorage(data, insert=None, update=None):
    # Implement the database storage logic
    pass
```

These files should contain the relevant functions for collecting specific statistics and interacting with the database.
Each file will import the necessary modules and implement the specific functionality.
    **boxscores.py**, 
    **boxouts.py**, 
    **clutch.py**, 
    **defense_dashboard.py**, 
    **general.py**, 
    **hustle.py**, 
    **opponent_shooting.py**, 
    **playtype.py**, 
    **rosters.py**, 
    **shooting.py**, 
    **shot_dashboard.py**, 
    **tracking.py**,
    **database.py**, 

Note:
    The code snippets above serve as a guideline to help you split the code into separate files.
    You'll need to fill in the actual logic within each function according to your requirements.
